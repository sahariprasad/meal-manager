# Meal Manager

A very simple meal manager based on user-defined recipes. The main focus of this project is to integrate with Siri through Siri Shortcuts, so that I can always know what I can cook with whatever is available in my grocery list.

Although this began as a personal project that runs on a little Raspberry Pi 3b at home, I'm expanding this into a generally-available service soon. This is still in early development, you can visit my repo and have a fork (or spoon :P).
